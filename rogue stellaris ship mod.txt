Ship overhaul mod

"RogueTech: Stellaris"

you will need something like dnyamic ui

Sadly will not be entirely compatible with ship or item mods
Overrides vanilla Ship sizes and Section Templates for new component system
Does not replace vanilla sets or items, so stuff like giga structure ships can be constructed classically

overrides vanilla auras (for star eater)

merger of my biophage and supremacy dreadnought and stargate ap mods

New Civis (more to come)
Biophage: merges most necrophage play into a single civic

New Traditions and expands upon Becoming the Crisis

All ship classes new required components

Remove basic utility slots, instead aux slots

Defense components go into 3 categories, average strength similar to balanced build

Shields: All shields go in here, upgrades similar to all vanilla tiers, selecting "None" Boosts Hull and Armor

Hull: New line of hull components

Armor: All Armors go in here, selecting "None" Boosts Hull and Shields

Enhancements: a selection of items that boost different defenses

Juggernaut Building: now you can change the juggernaut from being a shipyard to different roles

Advanced Ship Sections that provide more slots but cost very rare resources

Crisis ships nerfed to now have item cost and cost a bit of menace

New Technologies, ships, weapon and plattform parts when going Crisis

3 new plattform sections unlocked with "Jury Rigged Weapons"

New Weapons, from biological warheads and fighters, to a whole new range of weapons that fire a constant beam

New unique tech trees for other ascensions and machines will come in future

New Armies

Starbase Upgrade to one of the 5 ship defenses
Defenses scale through multi and additional weapon mounts
+2 Modules For citadel
1 aux slot per size

2 Aux for Defense Plattforms

Defense Plattforms use destroyer defenses

Defines tweaks include much higher fleet max, command limits and scales starbase and fleet size with number of pops

Rare resource edicts are now perpetual but require a upkeep, upkeep is a tenth of its activation cost

Includes "Fear of this battlestation" by ringbearer
