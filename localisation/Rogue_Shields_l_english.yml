 Rogue_Basic_Shield_SMALL_DESC:0 "Additional Armor and Hull Reinforcements instead of Shields"
 Rogue_Shield_Deflector_SMALL_DESC:0 "Energy deflector screens can stop a limited amount of incoming enemy fire before overloading. Their main drawback is that they consume large amounts of power."
 Rogue_Shield_ImpDeflector_SMALL_DESC:0 "These updated deflector screens are capable of soaking up even more punishment before they overload."
 Rogue_Shield_Shields_SMALL_DESC:0 "These new shield generators represent the next generation of energy screens, replacing the older deflector technology. They offer significantly better protection."
 Rogue_Shield_AdvShields_SMALL_DESC:0 "An updated shield generator that produces an even stronger energy field. Only sustained enemy fire can penetrate this barrier."
