alpha 0.2

Biophage is now a origin (quite a strong one)
It is based on planetary diversity infecting hive and uses the same code and planet classes for compatibility

reworked titan and juggernauts a bit
tweaked all icons

Added an additional starbase level for a maximum of 5 buildings and 10 modules (just looks nicer in dynui starbases)

Available to research after Nanolathe Engineering,
The Phalanx comes with even more weapons and a scalar cannon (1T, 2L, 4 Missiles, 4 Strike Craft, 2 PD)
Additionally it has double base armor and hull compared to a citadel

Also tweaked starbase weapons bonus from fire rate to damage

Advanced Shipyard Starbase Building now counts AS ANY! uplink for gigastructures
Nerfed its effect down to +2 Shipyards and +15% Build speed

requires to load AFTER! gigas

Tweaks because of 3.3
Subspace drones have 1% mult against sprawl penalties

Galactic Administration gains improved multi and minor added admin cap

added the forgotten nerf to crisis level required amounts

you can now instantly become the crisis, and you generate 0.1 menace per force projection unit

Added a new AP "Power Overwhelming", requires Galactic Force Projection
Grants additional admin cap, increases all production from force projection AND generates 1 unity from force projection

Additional Economic Starbase Modules and Buildings

Adds a Zro Refinery building

Attempt at teaching ai and job auto assign to use the exotic materials jobs reasonable 
nerfed these buildings a tiny bit

Made reaching higher crisis levels harder, but the aetherophasic engine upgrade costs have been halfed

Juggernauts and Rogue-Starbase stuff now have a influence upkeep

repurposed stealth fighters into drone swarm

New AP based tech and tweaks:

Had to override ascension paths to add the techs
All Ascensions for all empires, the usual restrictions apply, so psionics need psionic theory and biological requires gene tailoring
Synthetic evolution for machines -> synthetic age to syntehtic evolution instead of the flesh is weak

Biological:
Moved the bio tech tree to require genetic ascension
Grants t1 bio fighters and t1 bio hull on ascension

Psionics:
Added Psionic Lasers
Require Psionic Theory and Small amounts of Zro instead of energy and scales with laser tech
It counts as point defense and will shoot down missiles and strike craft, requires a minor amount less power
Several shield boosting components
Grants t1 lasers and t1 psi-shield-caps on ascension

Synth/Robot:
Drone Fighter, individually weaker but far larger swarms and they grant a small amount of extra armor
Aegis Armor, grants strong armor multiplier and regenerates
Grants t1 aegis and t1 drone fighters on ascension

!todo! techs for synth and psionics
repeatable additional energy weapon damage and shield strength for psionics, psionic army buffs
repeatable additional kinetic weapon damage and armor strength, improved build speeds
repeatable additional fighter and explosives damage + hull strength for biological

!todo!
Rework all ships slightly to permit 1-2 standard utilities
